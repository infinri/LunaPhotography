                <p class="about-description">
                    I started Infinri after watching too many small business owners get stuck between 
                    expensive agencies and unreliable freelancers. You need an affordable website developer who answers the phone, 
                    delivers on time, and charges fair prices without the runaround.
                </p>
                <p class="about-description">
                    So I built a web development studio that works the way you do: transparent pricing, 
                    fast turnarounds, and real communication. No corporate speak, no bait-and-switch, 
                    just honest work from an experienced web developer who specializes in budget-friendly website solutions for small businesses.

                    Every service has a clear price before we start. No hourly rates that spiral out of control, 
                    no "it depends" estimates, no surprise bills. You see the menu, you pick what you need, 
                    and that's what you pay. Low-cost website packages from $10-$50. Affordable monthly support plans start at $10. 
                    One-time fixes from $20. All posted publicly no hidden fees.

                    I don't take on more work than I can deliver. Delivery time depends on website complexity basic 
                    templates typically 1-3 days, more complex sites take longer. Quick fixes usually 1-2 days. 
                    Monthly plan requests within 24 hours. If I say it'll be done Tuesday, it's done Tuesday—not 
                    "Tuesday-ish" or "we'll circle back." Your time matters, and I respect that.
